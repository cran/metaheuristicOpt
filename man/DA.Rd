\title{Optimization using Dragonfly Algorithm}
\usage{
DA(FUN, optimType = "MIN", numVar, numPopulation = 40, maxIter = 500,
  rangeVar)
}
\arguments{
\item{FUN}{an objective function or cost function,}

\item{optimType}{a string value that represent the type of optimization.
There are two option for this arguments: \code{"MIN"} and \code{"MAX"}.
The default value is \code{"MIN"}, which the function will do minimization.
Otherwise, you can use \code{"MAX"} for maximization problem.
The default value is \code{"MIN"}.}

\item{numVar}{a positive integer to determine the number variables.}

\item{numPopulation}{a positive integer to determine the number populations. The default value is 40.}

\item{maxIter}{a positive integer to determine the maximum number of iterations. The default value is 500.}

\item{rangeVar}{a matrix (\eqn{2 \times n}) containing the range of variables,
where \eqn{n} is the number of variables, and first and second rows
are the lower bound (minimum) and upper bound (maximum) values, respectively.
If all variable have equal upper bound, you can define \code{rangeVar} as
matrix (\eqn{2 \times 1}).}
}
\value{
\code{Vector [v1, v2, ..., vn]} where \code{n} is number variable
        and \code{vn} is value of \code{n-th} variable.
}
\description{
This is the internal function that implements Dragonfly
Algorithm. It is used to solve continuous optimization tasks.
Users do not need to call it directly,
but just use \code{\link{metaOpt}}.
}
\details{
This algorithm was proposed by (Mirjalili, 2015). The main inspiration of the
DA algorithm originates from the static and dynamic swarming behaviours of
dragonflies in nature. Two essential phases of optimization, exploration and
exploitation, are designed by modelling the social interaction of dragonflies
in navigating, searching for foods, and avoiding enemies when swarming
dynamically or statistically.

In order to find the optimal solution, the algorithm follow the following steps.
\itemize{
\item Initialization: Initialize the first population of dragonflies randomly,
      calculate the fitness of dragonflies and find the best dragonfly as
      food source and the worst dragonfly as enemy position.
\item Calculating Behaviour Weight that affecting fly direction and distance.
      First, find the neighbouring dragonflies for each dragonfly then calculate the behaviour weight.
      The behaviour weight consist of separation, alignment, cohesion, attracted toward food sources
      and distraction from enemy. The neighbouring dragonfly determined by the neighbouring radius
      that increasing linearly for each iteration.
\item Update the position each dragonfly using behaviour weight and the delta (same as velocity in PSO).
\item Calculate the fitness and update food and enemy position
\item Check termination criteria, if termination criterion is satisfied, return the
      food position as the optimal solution for given problem. Otherwise, back to Calculating Behaviour Weight steps.
